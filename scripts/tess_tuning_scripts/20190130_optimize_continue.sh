# kernel experiments:
# * default: "i/5;b/5;d=3/2"
# * just do identity term
# * change background order
# * change delta kernel order
# * change delta kernel half-size
# * change "identity" term order

# aperture experiments:
# * default: "0.71:7.0:6.0,1.41:7.0:6.0,2.82:7.0:6.0"
# * change the inner and outer boundary of background annulus
# * vary the aperture sizes
